# Odin Recipes

A simple project from **The Odin Project** curriculum, created to practice the fundamentals of HTML.

## 📚 What I Learned

Throughout this project, I worked on:

- Structuring **HTML pages**
- Creating **internal links** between pages
- Using **ordered** and **unordered** lists
- Storing and referencing images correctly from a dedicated folder
- Using **VSCode extensions**, including a spell checker, and configuring my `settings.json` file
- Managing files efficiently through **Bash** commands

I also tried practicing proper **Git workflows**, such as committing **focused, incremental changes** rather than trying to do everything at once.
