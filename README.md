# odin-recipes

During this first TOP project, I put into practice what I had learned in previous classes, including building HTML pages, creating links between these pages, creating ordered and unordered lists. I was able to store images in a specially created folder and extract them when I needed them. I used a VSCode spell-checking extension and updated the settings.json file to save the spelling of unrecognized words.

As for Bash, I moved, modified, and worked on files with great efficiency.


I also learned to work on each section of the project little by little rather than trying to do everything at once. In addition, I put into practice what I had learned about Git best practices and committing isolated features/changes.
